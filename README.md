Fighting Game in Python
Overview
Welcome to the Fighting Game repository! This project is a simple yet engaging fighting game developed using Python's tkinter library. Players can choose their characters, perform various attacks, and witness animated combat sequences. The game features a turn-based mechanism where two characters battle against each other until one emerges victorious. This project serves as a fun introduction to game development concepts and graphical user interfaces in Python.
